# PopMovies

PopMovies is an application that uses the MovieDB API to help discover the most popular movies.

## Architecture

PopMovies is in pure Swift UI, so it implements the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.

## Third-Party Libraries

It implements asynchronous image loading in SwiftUI using [URLImage](https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/url-image).

## Instructions

In order to build and run the app in the Simulator, it is not required any additional steps. All third-party libraries are automatically installed by Xcode using the Swift Package Manager.
